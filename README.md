## Reflection

This project came together fairly quickly (despite being unable to work on it continuously) as I had put quite a bit of time into learning Firebase after revisiting an older project. By this point I'd become more familiar with React and felt confident in being able to incorporate other libraries that weren't mentioned in the curriculum, such as React-Menu. The most challening part of this project was trying to make the user clicks on the image screen agnostic and I spent quite a bit of time on The Odin Project Discord looking for other folks who'd had similar issues. It took a good while of digging around to find a suitable 'Wimmelbilder' but I was really happy to find a painting I actually enjoyed looking at for hours on end.
